000000Now that the party is jumping
000001With the bass kicked in and the Vega's are pumpin'
000002Quick to the point, to the point, no faking
000003Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
000004Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
000005I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
000006And a high hat with a souped up tempo
000007I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
000008ollin' in my five point oh
000009ith my rag-top down so my hair can blow
