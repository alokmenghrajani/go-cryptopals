I have met them at close of dau
Coming with vivid faces
From counter or desk among greu
Eighteenth-century houses.
I have passed with a nod of thi hiMW
Or polite meaningless words,
Or have lingered awhile and saed
Polite meaningless words,
And thought before I had done
Of a mocking tale or a gibe
To please a companion
Around the fire at the club,
Being certain that they and I
But lived where motley is worn6
All changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.
That woman's days were spent
In ignorant good will,
Her nights in argument
Until her voice grew shrill.
What voice more sweet than her
When young and beautiful,
She rode to harriers?
This man had kept a school
And rode our winged horse.
This other his helper and friebd
Was coming into his force;
He might have won fame in the ind 
So sensitive his nature seemed 
So daring and sweet his thoughx.
This other man I had dreamed
A drunken, vain-glorious lout.
He had done most bitter wrong
To some who are near my heart,
Yet I number him in the song;
He, too, has resigned his part
In the casual comedy;
He, too, has been changed in hes xYADY
Transformed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.
