I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell 
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell 
In ecstasy in the back of me 
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's 
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy 
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy. 

I'm lettin' my drug kick in 
It controls my mouth and I begin 
To just let it flow, let my concepts go 
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go! 

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be 
And if you don't give a damn, then 
Why you starin' at me 
So get off 'cause I control the stage 
There's no dissin' allowed 
I'm in my own phase 
The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok 
And I can dance better than any kid n' play 

Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to 
It's off my head so let the beat play through 
So I can funk it up and make it sound good 
1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood 
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious 
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious 
I'm an effect and that you can bet 
I can take a fly girl and make her wet. 

I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah 
There's no denyin', You can try to hang 
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style 
Over and over, practice makes perfect 
But not if you're a loafer. 

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls 
Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat 
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it! 

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino 
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino 
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin' 
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin' 
'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue 
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along 
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song 
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse. 

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi 
Startled by the bases hittin' ground 
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down 
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic 
You trapped me once and I thought that 
You might have it 
So step down and lend me your ear 
'89 in my time! You, '90 is my year. 

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it 
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it 
So don't be mad and don't be sad 
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad 
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure 
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure 
So come up close and don't be square 
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere 

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong 
So come on, everybody and sing this song 

Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go 
play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go 
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die. 

Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear 
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it

I have met them at close of daD
Coming with vivid faces
From counter or desk among greD
Eighteenth-century houses.
I have passed with a nod of thX higl
Or polite meaningless words,
Or have lingered awhile and saTd
Polite meaningless words,
And thought before I had done
Of a mocking tale or a gibe
To please a companion
Around the fire at the club,
Being certain that they and I
But lived where motley is worn
All changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.
That woman's days were spent
In ignorant good will,
Her nights in argument
Until her voice grew shrill.
What voice more sweet than herN
When young and beautiful,
She rode to harriers?
This man had kept a school
And rode our winged horse.
This other his helper and frieSd
Was coming into his force;
He might have won fame in the Xnd 
So sensitive his nature seemed
So daring and sweet his thoughI.
This other man I had dreamed
A drunken, vain-glorious lout.
He had done most bitter wrong
To some who are near my heart,
Yet I number him in the song;
He, too, has resigned his part
In the casual comedy;
He, too, has been changed in hTs xsz Z
Transformed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.

I'm rated "R"...this is a warning, ya better void / Poets are paranoid, DJ's D-stroyed
Cuz I came back to attack others in spite- / Strike like lightnin', It's quite frightenin'!
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park / Not a scream or a cry, or a bark, more like a sparj<
Ya tremble like a alcoholic, muscles tighten up / What's that, lighten up! You see a sight but
Suddenly you feel like your in a horror flick / You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quicj&
Music's the clue, when I come your warned / Apocalypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone!
Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer? / This is the death penalty,and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this / Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist!
Friday the thirteenth, walking down Elm Street / You come in my realm ya get beat!
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry / All ya see is the meters at a volume
Terror in the styles, never error-files / Indeed I'm known-your exiled!
For those that oppose to be level or next to this / I ain't a devil and this ain't the Exorcist 
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep a wink / The pain's a migraine every time ya thhik
Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear: / The R-A-K-I-M in your ear;
Then the beat is hysterical / That makes Eric go get a ax and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is superior / Faces of death remain
MC's decaying, cuz they never stayed / The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know / It's only one capable, breaks-the unbreakable
Melodies-unmakable, pattern-unescapable / A horn if want the style I posses
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest / For those that envy a MC it can be
Hazardous to your health so be friendly / A matter of life and death, just like a etch-a-sketch
Shake 'till your clear, make it disappear, make the next / After the ceremony, let the rhyme rers iE peMcX
If not, my soul'll release! / The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated, I'm glad you made hs
Cuz your about to see a disastrous sight / A performance never again performed on a mic:
Lyrics of fury! A fearified freestyle! / The "R" is in the house-too much tension!
Make sure the system's loud when I mention / Phrases that's fearsome
You want to hear some sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums; / I sit back and obrbrvN thI J xoZ JyJqE z
Then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me / Strictly business I'm quickly in this mood
And I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness! / I'm a tear you apart but I'm a spare you a hdfrt
Program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start / Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as tib cYaziIsI
Musical madness MC ever made, see it's / Now an emergency, open-heart surgery
Open your mind, you will find every word'll be / Furier than ever, I remain the furture
Battle's tempting...whatever suits ya! / For words the sentence, there's no resemblance
You think you're ruffer, then suffer the consequences! / I'm never dying-terrifying results
I wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts / Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiatini
Novocain ease the pain it might save him / If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury
Yo Rakim, what's up? / Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E., man I'm trying to get paid in full
Well, check this out, since Norby Walters is our agency, right? / True
Kara Lewis is our agent, word up / Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company, indeed
Okay, so who we rollin' with then? We rollin' with Rush / Of Rushtown Management
Check this out, since we talking over / This def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'? / And together, we can get paid!nn Mull
Thinkin' of a master plan / 'Cuz ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent / So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence / Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid / So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny / Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthio  mDve NuIhckZ TuAzY
But now I learned to earn 'cuz I'm righteous / I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search for a nine to five, if I strive / Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this / Feelin' out of place 'cuz, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of / Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish / But without no money it's still a wish
'Cuz I don't like to dream about gettin' paid / So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I maeb
So now to test to see if I got pull / Hit the studio, 'cuz I'm paid in full
Rakim, check this out, yo / You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad / 'Cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you're saying / So let's just pump the music up
And count our money / Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
Turn down the bass down / And let the beat just keep on rockin'
And we outta here / Yo, what happened to peace? / Peace
